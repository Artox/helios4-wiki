# Welcome to the Helios4 Wiki.

Helios4 is a powerful ARM based board specially designed for Network Attached Storage. It harnesses its processing capabilities from the **ARMADA 38x-MicroSoM** from [SolidRun](https://wiki.solid-run.com/doku.php?id=products:a38x:microsom).

The **Marvell ARMADAÂ® 388** is a robust and energy-efficient System on Chip (SoC) with a collection of high speed interfaces especially suited for headless data processing, networking and storage. This Dual-core ARM Cortex A9 CPU clocked at 1.6 Ghz, paired with 2GB of ECC memory, integrates a Cryptographic and XOR DMA engines to provide the best level of performance and reliability for NAS functionalities.

The Helios4 is an open source and open hardware project, therefore our objective is to publish any data related to the project on this Wiki.

**Beside consolidating technical data, the purpose of this Wiki is also to provide guideline on how to setup your Helios4.**
