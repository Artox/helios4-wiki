# Welcome to the Helios4 Wiki.

Helios4 is a powerful ARM based board specially designed for Network Attached Storage setups. It harnesses its processing capabilities from the ARMADA 38x-MicroSoM from SolidRun.

The Marvell ARMADAÂ® 388 is a robust and energy-efficient System on Chip (SoC) with a collection of high speed interfaces especially suited for headless data processing, networking and storage. This Dual-core ARM Cortex A9 CPU clocked at 1.6 Ghz integrates a Cryptographic and XOR DMA engines to provide the best level of performance for NAS functionality.

The Helios4 is an open source and open hardware project, therefore we will do our best to publish any data related to the project on this wiki.

**Beside consolidating technical data, the purpose of this wiki is also to provide guideline on how to setup your Helios4.**
